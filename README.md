# Bike Sharing Model
> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
The company wants to know:

-Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
-How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
- We were required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 


## Conclusions
- Recommendations to BoomBikes company:
1. Demand for shared bikes is going to increase year by year among the people, after this ongoing quarantine situation ends.

2. The best period for good business, when bikes demand is highest, is summer and early fall - June to September months every year. (This is evident from EDA and also since atemp variable is the most significant variable of our model).

3. Bikes demands will be high on a working day, in clear weather.

4. During the spring the bikes demand may decrease, but as the spring ends and summer starts the demand for bikes will increase.

5. Light rains may affect the demand for bikes.

6. On the days when windspeed is high, (typically this may happen in March and April months), the demand for bikes will remain low.
